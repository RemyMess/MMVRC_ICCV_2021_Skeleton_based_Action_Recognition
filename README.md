# MMVRC_ICCV_2021_Skeleton_based_Action_Recognition

"Skeleton-based action recognition which aims to recognize human behaviors given skeletal data has been attracting more and more attentions, as skeletons are concise and powerful representations for human behaviors. However, existing works lack viewpoints from the UAV perspectives, which are important in many real-world application scenarios, such as catastrophe rescue, city surveillance and wild patrol. These are some situations where humans are out of reach but monitoring and understanding humans' behaviors are highly demanded."
